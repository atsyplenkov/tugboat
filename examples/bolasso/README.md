# Boostrapped Lasso - Variable Selection Analysis

This directory contains a simple predictive modeling analysis with
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and R. It serves as a simple test-case
for tugboat.

NOTE: this example has quite a few dependencies so building the docker image
will take quite a while.
