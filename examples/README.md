Each directory in `tugboat/examples` shows a worked example of how to use tugboat
to convert an analysis directory into a corresponding Docker container. In each example,
`run.R` is the script that demonstrates how to use tugboat to generate the Dockerfile/container.
If you'd like to build the examples, you can interactively run/experiment with the code in `run.R`.
All other files are analysis files.
